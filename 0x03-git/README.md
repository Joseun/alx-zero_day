TASK 4. Collaboration: be up to date

I updated 0x03-git and modified its README.md

This is among some of the changes in Collaboration: be up to date

This program is currently in the works and I hope to collaborate with my advancing knowledge on projects soon.

It would be nice if any tips can be added
